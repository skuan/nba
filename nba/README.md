Summary: This project applies an evolutionary algorithm to evolve a neural network to analyze and predict outcomes to NBA games.
All the files in the project were written in Python 2.7

Quick Start:
Install the NEAT library using `pip install neat-python==0.1`.

Run `python nba_predict.py`.

Run `python testing.py` and type in full team names (San Antonio Spurs, Minnesota Timberwolves, etc.) to see predictions.
